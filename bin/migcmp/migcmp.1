.SH NAME
migcmp - copies/compresses/decompresses data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBmigcmp base= inwfd= outwfd= [+/-v +/-c +/-d +a +/-rename mode=0xxx]\fP 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program copies the data files pointed to in the input wfdisc to
the directory specified by base and outputs the new wfdisc and remark entries
to the specified prefix.  If the output wfdisc or remark files exist, the
new entries are appended to the existing files.  Unique commids are assigned
to the remarks to be output.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP
base= Specified directory to write data to
.IP
inwfd= Prefix of input wfdisc and remark files
.IP
outwfd= Prefix of output wfdisc and remark files
.IP
+/-v Turns on/off verbose mode (default is off)
.IP
+/-c Turns on/off data compression (default is off)
.IP
+/-d Turns on/off data decompression (default is off)
.IP

.SH NOTES
.PP
Only one of the options +c or +d may be selected.  If more than one is 
selected, an error message will be output and the program will exit.

.SH BUGS
.PP
If the user has selected the decompress option, "+d", the input wfdisc
must not contain any references to uncompressed data.  Uncompressed data
fed through the decompression scheme of migcmp will not produce an error
but the resulting binary waveform data will be garbage.
