Most of this code was imported from the IDA DCC time_vol sources, and
therefore won't build under the normal IDA development environment
(ie, mine).  

Before you type make, make sure you do this:

source /opt/css/setup.csh
source /opt/idadcc/setup.csh
source /opt/antelope/4.8/setup.csh

I have not tried this on anything other than a Solaris sparc machine.
