# The detector file is used to define the qhlp event detector and consists
# of a variable number of items.  The first 6 are always the same:
#
#   1 - The site name for which this is to be applied, or 'default'
#   2 - A comma delimited string listing the names of the triggered channels
#   3 - mininum number of 'on' channels required to declare an event
#   4 - Pre-event memory, in packets
#   5 - Post-event memory, in packets
#   6 - Type of detector.  Currently only 'stalta' is supported.
#
# The remaining parameters are specific to the type of detector.  For stalta
#
#   7 - STA window length, in samples
#   8 - LTA window length, in samples
#   9 - STA/LTA ratio needed to transition from off to on
#  10 - STA/LTA ratio needed to transition from on to off
#
# Site       Channels     Votes Pre Post   Type  STA  LTA   On  Off
