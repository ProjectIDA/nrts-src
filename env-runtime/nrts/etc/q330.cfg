# The q330.cfg file describes system and sensor assignments and consists
# of 4 arguments:
#
#   1 - The /etc/hosts name of the digitizer.
#   2 - The digitizer property tag number (if network connection)
#       else /etc/hosts name of Digi or serial device path
#   3 - Complex name describing sensor A input
#   4 - Complex name describing sensor B input
#
# The complex input names must exactly match the complex input names
# in the 'calib' configuration file.  These names consist of up to
# three ':' delimited strings in the form sensor[:e300[:x]] where only
# 'sensor' is required and must exactly match a name from the 'sensor'
# config file.
#
# For most sensors, the complex name will normally be just the name
# from the sensor file.  For the STS-1, if an E300 is present then the
# /etc/hosts name of the Digi which is connected to the E300 console
# should follow (eg, 'sts1:e300').  An optional third parameter can
# be specified for all sensors, if there is a need to differentiate
# between instruments with similiar control lines but different amplitude
# response.  No other significance is given to this argument... it is
# used solely for constructing unique complex names for the 'calib' table.
#
# For instance, an STS-1 with a SIB that has resistors on the calib
# input should be represented with the tag 'r' in the final field.  A
# high-gain STS-2 should be represented with the tag 'hi'.  Other tags
# can be assigned as desired.  Some examples:
#
# sts1:e300:r - STS-1 with an E330 and resistors in the SIB
# sts1::r     - STS-1 with old feedback boxes and resistors in the SIB
# sts2::hi    - high gain STS-2
#
#  Name      TagNo  Sensor A     Sensor B
